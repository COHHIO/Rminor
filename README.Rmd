An open-source HMIS custom reporting Shiny app created by Ohio Balance of State CoC.

This repository would be helpful to any HUD-designated Continuum of Care looking for a way to get more out of their HMIS data. 

### About

This is an open source project released under the GNU AGPLv3 license. See LICENSE for more details or visit the official GNU page at http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html.

All the code in this repository is written using R and R Studio. Please consult the book [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) for help getting started with R and R Studio.

### Data Source

This app takes the .Rdata files from the COHHIO_HMIS project (see that repo for details) via a symbolic link. This way, processing happens once, somewhere else, and not so much in the app.

If you clone or fork this, create a data folder in your R project and set up symbolic links to the .RData files in your COHHIO_HMIS/images directory.

### Security

No HMIS data is ever included in this repository. To make this code work, you will need to supply your own HMIS data. You are responsible for securing your HUD CSV export on your computer and ensuring that it is not compromised using whatever security measures you use for that locally.
