Shiny app for Ohio Balance of State CoC custom reporting

This app takes the .Rdata files from the COHHIO_HMIS project (see that repo for details) via a symbolic link. This way, processing happens once, somewhere else, and not as much in the app.

The overall aim for this app is to offer public-facing performance reporting for the Ohio Balance of State CoC. This repo contains the code that makes it all possible. There is no data shared here, only the code.
